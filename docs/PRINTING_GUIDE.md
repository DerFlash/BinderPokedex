## ✂️ After Printing: Cutting

### Card Header Layout:
Each card features:

- Pokémon name in selected language
- English subtitle for non-English cards (for reference)
- Pokémon type indicator

### What you need:
- ✂️ Sharp scissors or craft knife
- 📏 Ruler (optional, for precise cuts)
- 🛑 Cutting mat (optional, for safety)

### Instructions:
1. **Follow the dashed lines**
   - The dashed lines around each card show exactly where to cut
   - They are positioned between cards (4mm spacing)

2. **Cutting technique:**
   - Option A: Cut along dashed lines with scissors
   - Option B: Use craft knife and ruler for more precision
   - Tip: Cut vertically first, then horizontally

3. **Recommended order:**
   - First cut lines between columns (vertical)
   - Then cut lines between rows (horizontal)
   - Finally cut individual cards from strips

4. **Quality check:**
   - Verify all edges are straight
   - Damaged edges can be trimmed with scissors

## 📐 Size Verification

After cutting, your cards should measure:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   63.5 mm Width     │
│                     │
│ 88.9 mm             │
│ Height              │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Test:** Card should fit perfectly into a standard TCG binder sleeve!
