# Featured Pokémon - Selection and Concept

Documentation of the selected Featured Pokémon for all Pokédex generations and Variant collections. These Pokémon are prominently displayed on cover pages.

## 📋 Requirements for Featured Pokémon

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:**
- **Featured Pokémon MUST originate from the respective collection/section**
- A Featured Pokémon cannot be added from outside
- It must actually be contained in the pokemon_indices of the section
- This guarantees that Featured Pokémon are representative of the collection

**Selection Strategy:**
1. Collect all unique Pokémon in the section
2. Select the 3 most iconic/best ones (usually the first 3 by order or strength)
3. Duplicates are deduplicated (order of first occurrence)
4. Sections with < 3 Pokémon get only as many as available

## ✅ Overview: Uniqueness

✅ **Total unique Pokémon:**
- Pokédex: 27
- Variants: 27
- **Total: 54 different Pokémon**

❌ **No duplicates** between:
- Generations with each other
- Variants with each other
- Generations and Variants

### Duplicates **within** Variants are intentional!
The Pokémon lists of sections intentionally contain duplicates (e.g., Pikachu, Charizard), as they are based on real TCG sets that actually contain these Pokémon multiple times. However, the **iconic_pokemon** (for cover pages) are unique.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Legendarity:** Each Pokémon is either legendary, mythical, or a strong metagame figure
2. **Regional Representation:** Each generation showcases its core legendaries
3. **Variety:** No overuse of individual Pokémon (especially important: Charizard appears in only 3 PDFs, not all)
4. **Thematic Coherence:** Sections have thematically fitting Pokémon
5. **Symbolism:** Triads represent forces or concepts (Time-Space-Distortion, Legendary Birds, etc.)
